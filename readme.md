This code aims to help researchers to sort their reference list. To achieve this goal, it takes a list file unorganised and return a new organised one.

I am a beginner Python practitioner, so any help will be welcome.

I still need to fix: /n
-input and output files /n
-the output file could be better formatted /n
-blank lines need to be treated once it is sorted before the references instead of between then
